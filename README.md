Cyber Scroll 👾

Cyber Scroll is a neon-soaked, infinite vertical platformer built for the Scrolly x Superteam UK Game Jam.

Jump, shoot, and survive the ascent. Can you beat the boss?

🎮 About The Game

Cyber Scroll takes the addictive nature of vertical scrolling feeds and turns it into a high-octane arcade survival game.

Features:

Infinite Verticality: The higher you go, the harder it gets.

Boss Battles: Every 5 levels, the game shifts to "Boss Mode"—gravity turns off, auto-fire turns on, and you must dodge lasers to defeat the enemy ship.

Crypto Power-ups: Collect BITs, BYTES, CORES, and the legendary SOL orb to boost your score and jump height.

Dynamic Themes: Visuals shift as you progress, from Neon City to the Asteroid Belt and Galactic War zones.

Mobile First: Designed to look and feel great on mobile devices (touch/drag controls) while supporting desktop play (arrow keys).

🚀 Tech Stack

React: For UI and state management.

TypeScript: For type-safe game logic.

Tailwind CSS: For rapid, responsive styling.

Canvas API: For high-performance rendering of game entities (particles, stars, player).
